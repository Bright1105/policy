Jenny Store: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Jenny Store app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Bright Efosa. 

As an Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how frustrating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

Data collected by the app
I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that this app collects just the basic information of the user, the app only request for the (user) name, address and phone number to complete the order made by the user. All data created by the you (the user) is stored at the database which only (the user) can access, and can be simply erased by deleting your account. 

Permission	                                         Why it is required

android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS	               Required by the app to post notifications. Has to be granted by the user manually; can be revoked by the system or the user at any time. It is highly recommended that you allow this permission so that you can receive notifications.

android.permission.INTERNET                          Required by the app to access the internet. has been granted Automatically; can be revoked by the user at any time. It is highly recommended that you allow this permission so that you can use the Jenny App.                                                     


If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.


Yours sincerely,
Bright Efosa.
